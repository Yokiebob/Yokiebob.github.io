		<h1><a href = '../index.html'>Yokiebob<a>/About</h1>
		<h2>What I do.</h2>
		<p>I am a junior developer interested in <i>many</i> topics. I mostly develop small web-based (free)
		games that run completely on client side, but do enjoy code golfing and making stuff just for kicks.
		Some of my major works in progress include decrypting webgl/webgpu, using wasm correctly, and getting a sane workflow
		running on my chromebook.</p>
		<h2>Languages</h2>
		<p>My best programming language is definitely Javascript, but I am unfortunately a purist so I constantly try 
		to learn more languages. I know small amounts of c/c++, can do stuff with python if I can look up some syntax 
		stuff every now and then. I wrote a fibanocci program in Rust but it was horrible and am never going back.
		Always ready to learn more languages, but try to stay away from esolang before I try to learn one of them.</p>
		<h2>Where you can find me.</h2>
		<p>You can find me on <a href = 'https://khanacademy.org/profile/yokiebob'>Khanacademy</a>,
		<a href = 'https://github.com/Yokiebob'>Github</a>, and a few places, going by Yokiebob of course.</p>
		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>Right now I am mainly interested in ways to render shapes on the web quickly and reasonably. This means I am 
		learning Webgpu and other ways to render on a canvas, and svg's. I am also learning about virtual machines and emulation,
		plus trying to make my own language.</p>
